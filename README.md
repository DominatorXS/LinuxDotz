# LinuxDotz
Repository for my Linux dot files.

Requiremets:

feh (for wallpaper)
polybar (bar)
rofi (i am using adi1090x's rofi config, you can download it. it should start working out of the box.)



*IN POLYBAR, YOU NEED TO SET YOUR GPU NAME (radeon_bl0 in my case) FOR BRIGHTNESS TO WORK, ALSO YOU CAN ENABLE WIFI BY ADDING 'wlan' IN 'modules-right' under '[bar/main]*
